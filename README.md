# WC Secondary Product Thumbnail

WC Secondary Product Thumbnail is a very simple plugin that adds a secondary product thumbnail on product archives that is revealed when you hover over the main product image.

This plugin is ideal if you'd like to display more than one image on product archives, and perfect if you want to display front and back images of clothing for example.

### Other Features by WC SPT

* High-performance animations using CSS3 transitions
* Fallback to jQuery's .animate(), if needed
* Ultra lightweight
* Does not load its JavaScript and CSS, and also secondary thumbnails on mobile devices
* Works in almost every desktop browser

This is a fork of the [WooCommerce Product Image Flipper](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-product-image-flipper/) plugin by James Koster. All previous changelog can be found there.

### Changes & Improvements Highlights

* Removed image moving up and down animations, now just simple fade in and fade out.
* Disabled plugin's functionality on mobile devices (since this plugin is supposed to only work on devices with mouse).
* Improved themes compatibility.
* Works in IE8+ and all of the evergreen browsers.
