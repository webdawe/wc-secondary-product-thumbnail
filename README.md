# WC Secondary Product Thumbnail

WC Secondary Product Thumbnail is a very simple plugin that adds a secondary product thumbnail on product archives that is revealed when you hover over the main product image.

This plugin is ideal if you'd like to display more than one image on product archives, and perfect if you want to display front and back images of clothing for example.

This is a fork of the [WooCommerce Product Image Flipper](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-product-image-flipper/) plugin by James Koster. All previous changelogs can be found there.

### Changes & Improvements Highlights

* Remove image moving up and down animations, now just simple fade in and fade out.
* Disable plugin's functionality on mobile devices (since this plugin is supposed to only work on devices with mouse).
* Improved themes compatibility.
* Works in IE8+ and all of the evergreen browsers.
